### Who is this workshop for?

The workshop is intended for Rust beginners who want to learn how to build TUIs with Ratatui.
Previous experience with Rust is not required, but it is recommended to have a basic understanding of the language.

- If you are already familiar with Rust, you can still follow along and learn about Ratatui.
- If you are already familiar with Ratatui, you can follow the _bonus tracks_ and learn something new!

#### Necessary Tools

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
